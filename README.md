# MatlabFSN
Some tools needed by myself in study.
Descriptions will be given in the script.

1. timeSeriesData.m
    This is to help myself to solve the problem of organizing the time series data (e.g. temperature, precipitation etc.).
    Gaps in date and measurement would be detected and filled.
    Supports Matlab R2016 and after.
2. SWEREF2WGS84.m
    This is to help myself to convert coordinates from Swedish reference system (RT90, SWEREF90) to WGS84. Translated from Javascript by
